I work on failure of materials and friction/earthquakes. 
I mainly use numerical modeling of solids, high-performance computing and theoretical models. 
I also have experience on experimental fracture mechanics and Digital Image Correlation.

I am a forth year PhD candidate at Cornell University and visiting researcher at ETH Zurich. 
I am lucky to be advised by [David Kammer](https://ifb.ethz.ch/compmech) and my dissertation is on "dynamic fracture of heterogeneous materials". 
I worked on an experimental project on fracture of 3D printed materials with [Laurent Ponson](http://www.laurentponson.com/).
I collaborated with [Ahmed Elbanna](https://publish.illinois.edu/mcslabuiuc/) on the development of a new numerical method coupling Finite Elements and Boundary Elements.
Currently, I am using theoretical and numerical models to study statistical properties of static friction in collaboration with [Mircea Grigoriu](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/mircea-dan-grigoriu). 
I am planning to work with [Greg McLaskey](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/mclaskey/) and use similar theoretical and numerical models to better understand experimental data of laboratory scale earthquakes.
