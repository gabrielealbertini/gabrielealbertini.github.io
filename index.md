I work on failure of materials and friction/earthquakes. 
I mainly use numerical modeling of solids, high-performance computing and theoretical models. 
I also have experience on experimental fracture mechanics and Digital Image Correlation.

I am a forth year PhD candidate at Cornell University and visiting researcher at ETH Zurich. 
I am lucky to be advised by [David Kammer](https://ifb.ethz.ch/compmech){:target="_blank"} and my dissertation is on *dynamic fracture of heterogeneous materials*. 

I used numerical and theoretical models to uncover the *physical mechanisms governing friction* in a collaboration with [Jay Fineberg](http://old.phys.huji.ac.il/~jay/){:target="_blank"} and [Ilya Svetlizky](https://scholar.google.co.il/citations?user=44mVMhIAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, who performed the experimental work.

I worked on an experimental project on fracture of *multi-material 3D printed polymers* with [Laurent Ponson](http://www.laurentponson.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Mathias Lebihain](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZUSWpmMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"}.

I collaborated with [Ahmed Elbanna](https://publish.illinois.edu/mcslabuiuc/){:target="_blank"} on the development of a new *hybrid numerical method* coupling Finite Elements and Boundary Elements.

Currently, I am using theoretical and numerical models to study the *stochastic properties of static friction* in collaboration with [Mircea Grigoriu](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/mircea-dan-grigoriu){:target="_blank"}. 

I am planning to work with [Greg McLaskey](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/mclaskey/){:target="_blank"} and use theoretical and numerical models to uncover the friction law of laboratory scale earthquakes performed on 3m granite samples.
