I work on fracture of materials, friction and earthquakes. 
I use a combination of numerical and theoretical models to gain better understanding of experimental observation. 
I also have experience on experimental fracture mechanics and friction. In these experiments, I measure motion and deformation of the material using [Digital-Image-Correlation](research.md){:target="_blank"} and Machine-Learning-based techniques.

I am Assistant Professor at the Faculy of Engineering at the University of Nottingham, UK.
Previously, I was a Swiss National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University.
I worked with [Katia Bertoldi](https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} on tunable frictional surfaces.
I also worked with [Dave Weitz](https://weitzlab.seas.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} on the dynamics of extended fractures.

I received my PhD at Cornell University under the guidance of [Dave Kammer](https://ifb.ethz.ch/compmech/people/prof-dr-david-kammer.html){:target="_blank"} and my dissertation is on [Nucleation and Propagation of Fracture in Heterogeneous Materials](https://www-proquest-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/dissertations-theses/nucleation-propagation-fracture-heterogeneous/docview/2550608833/se-2?accountid=10267){:target="_blank"}.

I used numerical and theoretical models to uncover the [physical mechanisms governing friction](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2019.103826){:target="_blank"} in a collaboration with [Jay Fineberg](http://old.phys.huji.ac.il/~jay/){:target="_blank"} and [Ilya Svetlizky](https://scholar.google.co.il/citations?user=44mVMhIAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, who performed the experimental work.

I worked on an experimental project on fracture of [multi-material 3D printed polymers](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.035501){:target="_blank"} with [Laurent Ponson](http://www.laurentponson.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Mathias Lebihain](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZUSWpmMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"}.

I collaborated with [Ahmed Elbanna](http://publish.illinois.edu/mcslabuiuc/people/ahmed-ettaf-elbanna/){:target="_blank"} on the development of a new [hybrid numerical method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08756){:target="_blank"} coupling Finite Elements and Boundary Elements.

I used theoretical and numerical models to study the [stochastic properties of static friction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06113){:target="_blank"} in collaboration with [Mircea Grigoriu](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/mircea-dan-grigoriu){:target="_blank"}. 

I am working with [Greg McLaskey](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/mclaskey/people.html){:target="_blank"} and [Chun-Yu Ke](https://chunyuke.com/){:target="_blank"} and use theoretical and numerical models to uncover the friction law of laboratory scale earthquakes performed on a 3m granite fault.
