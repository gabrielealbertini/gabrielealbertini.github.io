Gabriele is Assistant Professor in Structural Engineering at the University of Nottingham, UK. His research focuses on fracture, friction, and earthquake source mechanics. He combines numerical and theoretical models to gain better understanding of experimental observation and uncover the underlying physics. He aims to address climate change, sustainability, and infrastructure resilience related challenges by developing new numerical modelling and experimental techniques and integrating them with validation testing, structural monitoring and probabilistic analyses. 
Previously, he was a Swiss National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University and received his PhD from Cornell University in 2021 with thesis titled "Nucleation and Propagation of Fracture in Heterogeneous Materials". During his doctoral training he was a vising researcher at ETH Zurich and at the Institut Jean le Rond d'Alembert at Sorbonne Université. He holds a BSc and a MSc in civil engineering at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).


<!-- work in progress

We work on numerical and experimental fracture mechanics and friction. In these experiments, we measure motion and deformation of the material using [Digital-Image-Correlation](research.md){:target="_blank"} and Machine-Learning-based techniques. We develop numerical modelling techniques allowing us to model failure of materials and deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanics.

In collaboration with [Laurent Ponson](http://www.laurentponson.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Mathias Lebihain](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZUSWpmMAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao){:target="_blank"}, we developed fracture experiments using [multi-material 3D printed polymers](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.127.035501){:target="_blank"}. This allowed us to test if a crack in a heterogeneous material follows the equation of motion predicted by brittle fracture theory.

We developed numerical and theoretical model for friction and collaborated with experimentalists ([Jay Fineberg](http://old.phys.huji.ac.il/~jay/){:target="_blank"} and [Ilya Svetlizky](https://scholar.google.co.il/citations?user=44mVMhIAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}) to uncover the [physical mechanisms governing friction](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2019.103826){:target="_blank"}

I work on fracture of materials, friction and earthquakes. 
I use a combination of numerical and theoretical models to gain better understanding of experimental observation. 

I am Assistant Professor at the Faculy of Engineering at the University of Nottingham, UK.
Previously, I was a Swiss National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard University.
I worked with [Katia Bertoldi](https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} on tunable frictional surfaces.
I also worked with [Dave Weitz](https://weitzlab.seas.harvard.edu/){:target="_blank"} on the dynamics of extended fractures.

I received my PhD at Cornell University under the guidance of [Dave Kammer](https://ifb.ethz.ch/compmech/people/prof-dr-david-kammer.html){:target="_blank"} and my dissertation is on [Nucleation and Propagation of Fracture in Heterogeneous Materials](https://www-proquest-com.proxy.library.cornell.edu/dissertations-theses/nucleation-propagation-fracture-heterogeneous/docview/2550608833/se-2?accountid=10267){:target="_blank"}.


I collaborated with [Ahmed Elbanna](http://publish.illinois.edu/mcslabuiuc/people/ahmed-ettaf-elbanna/){:target="_blank"} on the development of a new [hybrid numerical method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08756){:target="_blank"} coupling Finite Elements and Boundary Elements.

I used theoretical and numerical models to study the [stochastic properties of static friction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06113){:target="_blank"} in collaboration with [Mircea Grigoriu](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/mircea-dan-grigoriu){:target="_blank"}. 

I am working with [Greg McLaskey](https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/mclaskey/people.html){:target="_blank"} and [Chun-Yu Ke](https://chunyuke.com/){:target="_blank"} and use theoretical and numerical models to uncover the friction law of laboratory scale earthquakes performed on a 3m granite fault.
