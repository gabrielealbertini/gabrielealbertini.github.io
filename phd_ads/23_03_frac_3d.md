# PhD position: modelling of dynamic fracture in 3D

The Albertini Lab at the University of Nottingham has an opening for a PhD student (home or international) in modelling dynamic fracture in 3D. The position is fully funded on a competitive basis with starting date 2023/2024.

## Project background
We conduct research at the interface between mechanics, materials and scientific computing. Our research focusses on modelling the link between micro- to mesoscale properties of engineering and geophysical materials and their macroscale mechanical behaviour. The centre of our interests is on dynamic fracture, friction, earthquake source mechanics and granular material mechanics. We aim to provide a fundamental understanding of multi-scale and multi-physical mechanics of materials and develop predictive numerical tools for mechanical failure of materials and structures.

## Job Description
This position is part of a joint project between the Geo-Energy Research Centre and the Composites Research Group and focuses on understanding how fracture propagate in brittle materials such as rock, glass, ceramics, or concrete. This PhD position will focus on the modelling of the fracture in heterogeneous brittle materials. Most of our current understanding is based on two dimensional models and assume homogeneous material properties. However, real materials are three dimensional, mechanical properties vary spatially, and defects are present. These local variations and defects can have profound consequences on the macroscopic strength and toughness of the material but are poorly understood. The objective is to develop numerical models of fracture propagation in three dimensions that accounts for the realistic material properties and intricated crack path. This model will provide fundamental understanding on how fracture initiates, propagates, and arrests in a realistic material. The numerical results will then be compared to experimental data on ceramic composites and on 3d printed polymers from our collaborators within the University of Nottingham and at Harvard University. This knowledge will allow design and manufacture of future high-performance materials with superior impact resistance.

## Your Profile
-	You hold a Master degree in mechanical, civil or structural engineering, material science, physics or a related discipline and have a background in solid mechanics, applied mathematics, computational science or a related field.
-	Additionally, you have prior programming experience and are fluent in English (oral and written)
-	You show enthusiasm for conducting original research in an interdisciplinary and international team, and you strive for scientific excellence.
